### What is this?

This is the repository containing my own [tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/)
[extensions](https://tachiyomi.org/extensions/)

### What this is not

I will not accept source requests, this repository is only for sources I personally use.
I re-created the build logic almost from scratch with some help from the original
extensions repo and [ThePBone's one](https://github.com/ThePBone/tachiyomi-extensions-revived/).
I will create a repository template at a later date once I remove the rough edges to make
the process of creating one's own repository much easier.

### What extensions are contained in this repository?

As of now:

- [Project Suki](./extensions/projectsuki/README.md)
